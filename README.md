# Task-2


Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the EDA process conducted on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to understand the data structure, identify key patterns, trends, anomalies, and derive feature-level insights using a mix of statistical summaries and visualizations.

 Tools Used:
 
Pandas: Data manipulation and summary statistics
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and pattern analysis
Plotly: Interactive and insightful visual exploration

Dataset
We used the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle under the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. It contains data about passengers, including whether they survived or not.

Key Steps:
1.Data Loading & Summary
Loaded data using Pandas and reviewed data types, missing values, and summary statistics.

2.Missing Value Analysis
Identified missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked. Planned imputation or dropping where needed.

3.Univariate Analysis
Plotted histograms and boxplots to explore distributions and detect outliers in Age and Fare.

4.Bivariate Analysis
Females had higher survival rates than males.
1st class passengers survived more often than 3rd class.
Children had higher survival rates than adults.

5.Correlation & Pairplots
Explored relationships between numerical features using heatmaps and pairplots. Fare and Pclass were moderately correlated with Survived.
